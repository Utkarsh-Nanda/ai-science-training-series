Theory Homework Answers

1)
These AI accelerator systems integrate memory and compute on the same chip, unlike traditional von Neumann architectures where memory and compute are separated. 
They use dataflow-based execution where operations are triggered by data availability rather than sequential program counters. 
The systems contain thousands of processing elements with dedicated local memory, enabling massive parallelism for AI workloads.
2)
The key architectural differences between these AI accelerators lie in their unique processing approaches. 
Cerebras WSE uses independent processing elements with local memory, enabling true dataflow execution where operations are triggered by data availability. 
SambaNova's RDU employs a flexible dataflow architecture with a sophisticated multi-tiered memory system that efficiently handles large datasets. 
Graphcore's IPU takes a different approach with its BSP model, where processing tiles alternate between computation and communication phases in synchronized steps. 
Groq's TSP architecture stands apart by focusing on deterministic execution timing, making it particularly effective for low-latency inference tasks. 
Each system's unique memory architecture and execution model creates distinct advantages for different AI workloads.
3)
The workflow involves first accessing the system through SSH to ALCF login nodes, creating a Python virtual environment, and installing system-specific dependencies. 
For Cerebras, developers we can use CS-Torch  and modify YAML configuration files to specify data paths and runtime parameters. 
The code is then compiled and deployed using system-specific job schedulers like the Kubernetes-based system used by Cerebras.
4)
A large language model training project would significantly benefit from these accelerators. 
The systems have shown up to 66x speedup compared to traditional GPUs for LLM inference tasks. 
The massive parallelism and integrated memory architecture are good for handling the extensive matrix operations in transformer models,
while the dataflow execution model efficiently manages the complex dependencies in neural network computations.
